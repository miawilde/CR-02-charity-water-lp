        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2006 by Scott Harrison- a former NYC nightclub promoter turned humanitarian after volunteering on Mercy Ships, Charity: Water began with a bold idea: fund clean water projects in developing nations using social and innovative methods 
          From a launch party that raised $15,000 for African wells, they grew through viral grassroots efforts like “donate your birthday”, encouraging supporters to ask for donations instead of gifts .
          Their ethos of radical transparency means every public dollar funds projects directly, with GPS coordinates and publicly shared photos demostrating each dollar's impact.
